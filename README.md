# CREAM_analytics

## Objective
A clean UX containing relevant data and graphics from all C.R.E.A.M. money markets (eth v1, Iron Bank, BSC, Fantom, Polygon). Rather than provide a defined list of metrics/KPIs, Hackers should get creative here and build for what they feel is important for users of C.R.E.A.M. Finance. Please include a GitHub and demo of the product in the submission.

## Work Completed
- [x] I wrote sql queries to better understand indicators of how CREAM finance is performing in the crypto currency industry using Dune Analytics. This dashboard is pulling data from ETH v1.

## My Hackathon Experience
This is my first ever hackathon i have participated in. I have created dashboards and visualizations thorughout my career in data science however these are my first dashboards implemented off smart contracts.

It was a truly great experience that encourages me to further pursue my data science background in an applicabale manner using dune analytics and smart contracts. 

## Demo Video

This is my first ever screencast, so please have patience with me! Also, I had to use the built-in mic of my laptop, so apologies in advance for bad sound quality.

You can find my demo video on.
