# Live CREAM DUNE analytics

## Objective
A clean UX containing relevant data and graphics from all C.R.E.A.M. money markets (eth v1, Iron Bank, BSC, Fantom, Polygon). Rather than provide a defined list of metrics/KPIs, Hackers should get creative here and build for what they feel is important for users of C.R.E.A.M. Finance. Please include a GitHub and demo of the product in the submission.

## Work Completed
- [x] I wrote sql queries to better understand indicators of how CREAM finance is performing in the crypto currency industry using Dune Analytics. This dashboard is pulling data from ETH v1.
