# [Live CREAM DUNE analytics](https://dune.xyz/airbayer/CCCCCC)

## Objective
A clean UX containing relevant data and graphics from all C.R.E.A.M. money markets (eth v1, Iron Bank, BSC, Fantom, Polygon). Rather than provide a defined list of metrics/KPIs, Hackers should get creative here and build for what they feel is important for users of C.R.E.A.M. Finance. Please include a GitHub and demo of the product in the submission.

## Work Completed
- [x] I wrote sql queries to better understand indicators of how CREAM finance is performing in the crypto currency industry using Dune Analytics. This dashboard is pulling data from ETH v1. These queries are build to showcase the outstanding debt by token by day AND borrows by token by day. The other queries that i construsted are meant to highlight daily trade volume all time, accrued daily interest, total trade volume, and current cream holders. We can then build visuals based off these queries such as area charts, bar graphs, pie chart, sum table counter to display a sum of a particular metric such as total trade volume all time and price of token.

## Demo Video

You can find my demo video on. 

## Summary:
	1. KPI's
		* Total Users
		* Token Holders
		* Trade Volume
		* Trading Pairs
		* Outstanding debt per day metrics
		* Token Price
		* Borrows per day by token
		* Liquidation Success Rate
		* Interest accrued

	2.Limitation to the data. No Iron Bank, BSC, Fantom data for creamfinance on dune analytics. Currently working with Dune Analytics team to get CREAM Polygon network data 	  available on Dune Analytics.

## What's Next?
* Data tables for creamfinance to be available on dune analytics using the polygon.network the dashboard will be replicated from the ones used on ETH v1 dashbaord.
